                <p>Coffee is the brewed drink with a distinct aroma and flavour, prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds found inside "berries" of the coffee plant. coffee plants are cultivated in over 70 countries, primarly in equatorial latin america, southeast asia, india and africa. The two most commonly grown are the highly regarded arabica and the less sophisticated but stronger and more hardy robusta. The latter is resistant to the coffee leaf rust, Hemileia vastatrix, but has a more bitter taste. Once ripe, coffee beans are picked, processed, and dried. Green(unroasted) coffee beans are one of the most traded agricultural commodity in the world. Once traded, the beans are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavour, before being ground and brewed to create coffee. Coffeeis slightly acidic and can have a stimulating effect on humans because of its caffeine content. It is one of the most popular drinks in the world. It can be prepared and presented in various ways. The effect of the coffee on humans health has been a subject of the many studies, however, results have varied in terms of coffee relative benefit. The majority of recent research suggests that moderate coffee consumption is begining or mildly beneficial in healthy adults. however, the diterpenes in coffee may increase the risk of heart disease.  </p>
